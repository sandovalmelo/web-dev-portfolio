      <h2>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h2>
      <p class="about-text">The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to
        developer a skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business

        I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young minds about
        how to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.</p>

      <p class="about-text">As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is
        yourself.

        A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.

        "How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't fail?" You've already gone through the hardest parts being a
        developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader, in something you're passionate about.

        I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your company.</p>
